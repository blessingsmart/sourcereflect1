             <p>I have been involved in the fishery class for years, but I had never had the opportunity to see an aquarium in person, let alone construct one myself. However, thanks to Sourcerflect. I had the privilege of building and decorating a small-scale aquarium with my own hands. </p>
             <p>My experience with the sourcereflect team was truly remarkable. They employs a unique teaching method where he consistently includes relevant content related to the topics he covers.</p>
             <p>Additionally, he ensures that we practice everything we learn, which helps us retain the knowledge we have gained till date.</p>

             <p>hands-on involvement in fishery practices has improved my academic journey. Despite excelling in most subjects at Kuramo Senior College, my performance in fisheries studies lagged behind, causing frustration and disappointment. However, everything changed when Mr. Samson and his team introduced practical fishery sessions at our school.</p>
             <p>Engaging in activities like fish feeds formulations, Aquarium construction and design, fish culturing and aquatic habitat assessments provided invaluable insights that textbooks alone couldn't offer. Through these practical experiences, I gained a deeper understanding of fish behavior, habitat requirements, and industry challenges, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p>
             <p>Beyond academic enrichment, practical experience honed my problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and personal growth. Learning skills that aid a solid foundation for future career success.</p>
             <p>I am much grateful for the opportunity üôè</p>
